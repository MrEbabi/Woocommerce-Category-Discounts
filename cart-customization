    /*the function named generateCoupon() is another code that programmatically generates a coupon based on cart products 
     *with this function you can generate a dynamic coupon
     *example: 
     * coupon name: testcoupon
     * amount: will be calculated for every cart click
     * assume you have 15% discount for products in category A, so sale prices are calculated for those products
     * and you have 10% discount for products in category B, so sale prices are also calculated for those products 
     * and you have some other categories or products with no discounts
     * but you also want that some special customers to use a coupon with 25% discount from the regular price of all products
